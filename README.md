# Wireless Automated Attendance System

A system for automatically taking and storing attendance using fingerprint scanner.

## Description

The project work aims at eliminating the traditional paper-based attendance system. The traditional approach is more prone to error and requires a lot of overhead in terms of class-time. In addition, the paper-sheet could be manipulated. All these factors motivated us to design a new system that will both be automated, secure, less time-consuming and user-friendly. 

We chose the biometric identification system because it is now a well-matured field that can reliably identify a person and therefore can be used in our system to the aim of uniquely identifying a student. Specifically, we chose fingerprint-based detection as it is cheaper to implement than other prevalent biometric systems like face recognition and retina based detection.

After taking the attendance through a series of fingerprint matching and acknowledgement, the attendance data will be wirelessly stored in a central database by our system. This makes our system fully automated without any extra intervention by the designated teacher and any loss in class-time.

In addition, the attendance data will be integrated to make the full attendance report in order to facilitate the semester-wise mark generation of a student. 
In our system, there will be a box containing the necessary hardware for fingerprint taking and verification. And also for wireless transfer of attendance data. The data will be integrated afterwards with existing ones in the backend of the database server.
